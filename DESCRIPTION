Title: Printing Floating Point Numbers in a Human-Friendly Format
Description: Print vectors (and data frames) of floating point numbers
    using a non-scientific format optimized for human readers.  Vectors
    of numbers are rounded using significant digits, aligned at the
    decimal point, and all zeros trailing the decimal point are dropped.
